# Community Expectations

The foremost goal of the Mailchain community is to develop blockchain-based, simple, secure, decentralized messaging technology.

We also have an equally important goal: to create a community that fosters easy, agile development of such systems.

We therefore describe the expectations for members of the Mailchain community and encourage everyone to read the [code of conduct][code_of_conduct]. All particiants in the community should go above and beyond the code of conduct to promote a collaborative, respectful Mailchain community.

## Code Review

As a community we believe in the value of code review for all contributions. Code review increases the quality and readability of our code base, which helps produce high quality software.

See the [Github Workflow][github_workflow] for more information on code review.

The community expects that all active participants in the community will also be active reviewers. Please expect reviewers to request that you avoid [common go style mistakes](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) in your PRs.

### Expectations of reviewers: Review comments

Because reviewers are often the first points of contact between new members of the community and can significantly impact the first impression of the Mailchain community, reviewers are especially important in shaping the Mailchain community.

### Expectations of reviewers: Review latency

We expect reviewers to respond in a timely fashion to pull requests assigned to them.  We expect reviewers to respond to an *active* pull request with reasonable latency, and if reviewers do not respond, we may assign those pull requests to other reviewers.

If reviewers are unavailable to review for some time, they should set their [user status](https://help.github.com/en/articles/personalizing-your-profile#setting-a-status) to "busy" to avoid being assigned reviews. If they are unavailable for a longer time period, we expecte them to remove themselves from the CODEOWNERS file and potentially nominate someone else.

## Thanks

Many thanks in advance to everyone who contributes their time and effort to making Mailchain both a successful product and a successful community.

The strength of our software is a reflection of the strengths of each individual community member.
