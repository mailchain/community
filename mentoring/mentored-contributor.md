# Mentored Contributor Program

## Welcome and Summary

Welcome prospective mentee!

This is the first cohort of the *Mailchain Mentored Contributor Program* (but not our first time mentoring developers).

The Mentored Contributor Program (MCP) will guide you through a self-paced, semi-structured learning program over the course of three months.

It's geared towards developers with ambition to learn. From diving deep into blockchain ecosystems, writing better in Go, or helping decide what's next on the Mailchain roadmap, the MCP will help you gain the knowledge you need, earning credibility along the way.

During the three-month period, we will work with you identify specific areas of interest and growth to fit your goals. You'll also gain a full understanding of the Mailchain application and work on your programming skills (Go, blockchain, encryption, etc.)

You'll get to interact with peer contributors who are on a similar journey and work directly with experienced Mailchain developers as mentors.

We will match you with a mentor best suited to your experience and area of interest. They will guide you and help you to find answers to certain problems (but maybe not give you the solution immediately).

You will receive feedback on issues/PRs and have your code reviewed so that at the end of the three-month period, you'll be able to demonstrate personal and professional growth.

## Expectation

What you put in correlates to what you get out. We expect you to:

* Commit at least 20 hours per month.
* Remain in good standing throughout the program and uphold our [Code of Conduct][code_of_conduct].
* Expect respect from mentors and peers who are in the cohort with you.
* Work at your own pace but leverage standups to openly discuss your wins and blockers.
* Use the standups to cover topics related to skill growth, suggested activities, and suitable issues to work on.
* Be helpful and share knowledge with your peers in the cohort.
* Give back and become a mentor to future cohorts.

## Development Areas & Focussed Activities

We will decide these topics during bi-weekly standup/workshops. A general understanding of the entire code base is important, but there will be a focus on your area of interest. We will try to tailor activities to maximise menteeâ€™s learning, helping become owners of parts of the code base.

Examples of areas of development include:

* Blockchain protocols:
  * ethereum
  * substrate
  * bitcoin
  * other
* Mailchain
  * specification
  * proposals
  * sender
  * receiver
  * api endpoints
  * public key finder
  * storage
  * programmable envelopes
* Mailchain Web
  * Angular
* Tools
  * relay
  * address index
  * sent store
  * name service
* cryptography
  * secp256k1
  * ed25519
  * sr25519
  * nacl
  * aes256cbc
* Golang
  * GoDoc
  * package layout
* DevOps
  * Travis
  * golangci-lint
  * goreleaser
  * cgo
  * wasm

### How to apply to the program

Anyone can apply to the program through this [application form][mcp_application_form].

We review applications periodically and will let you know if we're able to add you to the program. In the meantime, don't hesitate to dive right in to the code!
