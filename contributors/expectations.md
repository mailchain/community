# Expectations

The foremost goal of the Mailchain community is to develop blockchain-based, simple, secure, decentralized messaging technology.

Equally, an important goal is the creation of a community that fosters easy, agile development of such systems.

We therefore describe the expectations for members of the Mailchain community.  We intend this document to be a living one that evolves alongside our community, following the same PR and code review processes that shapes the rest of the project.  The document covers the expectations of conduct that govern all members of the community and the expectations around code review that govern all active contributors to Mailchain.

## Code review

As a community we believe in the value of code review for all contributions. Code review increases the quality and readability of our code base, which helps produce high quality software.

See the [Github Workflow](./github-workflow.md) for more information on code review.

As a community we expect that all active participants in the community will also be active reviewers. Please expect reviewers to request that you avoid [common go style mistakes](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) in your PRs.

## Expectations of reviewers: Review comments

Because reviewers are often the first points of contact between new members of the community and can significantly impact the first impression of the Mailchain community, reviewers are especially important in shaping the Mailchain community.

We highly encourage reviewers to read the [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct) and strongly encourage them to go above and beyond the code of conduct to promote a collaborative, respectful Mailchain community.

## Expectations of reviewers: Review latency

We expect reviewers to respond in a timely fashion to pull requests assigned to them.  We expect reviewers to respond to an *active* pull request with reasonable latency, and if reviewers do not respond, we may assign those pull requests to other reviewers.

If reviewers are unavailable to review for some time, they to set their [user status](https://help.github.com/en/articles/personalizing-your-profile#setting-a-status) to "busy" to avoid being assigned reviews. If they are unavailable for a longer time period, we expected them to remove themselves from the CODEOWNERS file and potentially nominate someone else.

## Thanks

Many thanks in advance to everyone who contributes their time and effort to making Mailchain both a successful product and a successful community.

The strength of our software shines in the strengths of each individual community member.

Thanks!
