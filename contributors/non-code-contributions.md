# Non-Code Contributions

*If you are interested in helping define and structure this work, you can find us in the Non-Code Contribution [Slack channel](https://mailchain.slack.com/messages/non-code-contribution).*

*All contributors welcome, new and old!*

## What is this?

The list below is meant to help non-code contributors find areas of the Mailchain project where their expertise can be best utilized. The goal of this is to provide a starting guide for anyone looking to become a contributor not necessarily writing code.

This list is meant to be used by both new contributors looking for a good entrance into the project, and current contributors who would like to do something different.
